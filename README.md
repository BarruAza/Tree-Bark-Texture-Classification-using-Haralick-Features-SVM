# Tree-Bark-Texture-Classification-using-Haralick-Features-SVM
Parallel Feature Engineering for SVM. Efficiently classify tree bark images by extracting hybrid features (Texture + Color). Multithreading implementation is used to optimize the CPU-bound feature extraction process, resulting in faster model training and accurate SVM predictions.
